CorpusHandler
=============

Perl modules for automate processing of text. Designed to work
with TesseractPDF to aid in automatic categorization of OCR'ed text.

CorpusHandler works off a set of user-specified rules. The rules are
defined with simple syntax in a text file, for ease of setup and
testing. Rules can also be defined programatically via the API.
